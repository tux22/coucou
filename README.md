# Coucou

**A tiny friend that lives in your MacBook's notch — or at the top of your screen on Windows and Linux — and keeps an eye on your Claude Code sessions.**

Approve permissions, watch your agents work, drop a file, chat with Claude — all without leaving what you're doing.

## Why

Some studios showed off gorgeous notch companions… and never let anyone use them.
**Coucou is the open version.** Every line of code, every animation, every sound — free to use, read, fork and remix.

Meet **Mochi**: a soft little squircle with big eyes that pops out of your notch, waves hello, follows your cursor with its eyes, gets annoyed when you poke it (and dizzy if you insist), and tells you the moment Claude Code needs you.

## Features

- 🤖 **Claude Code, live** — see every session in your notch: what it reads, edits and runs, step by step. Finished? Mochi does a happy little jump.
- ✅ **Approve from the notch** — Claude Code permission requests show up with **Allow / Deny**. One click, back to work.
- 🧑‍💻 **Jump to the right terminal** — open the exact terminal window of a session *(macOS)*.
- 💬 **Ask Claude anything** — built-in chat, straight from the notch.
- 📎 **Drop a file on the notch** — Mochi turns into a box and swallows it, then ask a question about it or send it by email *(email: macOS, Mail.app)*.
- 🪟 **Drag Mochi onto any window** — attach that window as context for Claude *(macOS)*.
- 🔌 **Integrations** — Stripe payments, n8n workflows, GitHub, Vercel deployments, Resend emails, Notion, Cal.com. Each one gets its own little colored Mochi.
- 🎭 **A real character** — idle breathing, blinks, eyes on a sphere that follow your mouse, emotes, 28 handcrafted sounds, a greeting on launch.
- 🫥 **Invisible when idle** — hides away when nothing is running, peeks out when you hover the notch (the top edge of the screen on Windows and Linux).
- 🔒 **Private by design** — no telemetry, no account. Keys live in your macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager or Linux keyring. The app only talks to the services you plug in.

## Install

### Download for macOS

1. Grab the latest `Coucou.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases).
2. Unzip and move **Coucou.app** to `/Applications`.
3. Launch. This build isn't notarized by Apple yet, so the first time macOS says it can't verify the developer: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway** (only once).

### Windows

The Windows installer is **temporarily unavailable**. Microsoft Defender wrongly
flags the unsigned installer as malware; a false-positive report is under review
at Microsoft and the installer will come back once it is cleared and signed.
Until then you can [build it from source](#build-from-source).

There is no notch on a PC, so the island slides out of the top edge of the screen
instead of hiding inside one. See [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md) for the
rest of the differences.

### Download for Linux

From the [latest Linux release](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases/tag/linux-latest):

- **Debian / Ubuntu**: [`Coucou-Linux-amd64.deb`](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases/download/linux-latest/Coucou-Linux-amd64.deb) → `sudo apt install ./Coucou-Linux-amd64.deb`
- **Any distribution**: [`Coucou-Linux-x86_64.AppImage`](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases/download/linux-latest/Coucou-Linux-x86_64.AppImage) → `chmod +x` it and run it
- **Any distribution, no root**: [`Coucou-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz`](https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou/releases/download/linux-latest/Coucou-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz) → unpack and run `./install.sh`

It works like the Windows version and runs on X11 or XWayland. See the
[Linux section of `windows/README.md`](windows/README.md#linux).

### Build from source

**macOS** — requirements: macOS 15+, Xcode 16+, [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```bash
brew install xcodegen
git clone https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou.git
cd coucou/NotchBuddy
xcodegen
open NotchBuddy.xcodeproj   # then ⌘R
```

**Windows** — requirements: [Rust](https://rustup.rs), Node 20+, MSVC build tools.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou.git
cd coucou/windows
npm install
npm run pack                # installer lands in windows/release/
```

**Linux** — requirements: [Rust](https://rustup.rs), Node 20+, WebKitGTK 4.1 development files (full list in [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md#build)).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Louis-CFM/coucou.git
cd coucou/windows
npm install
npm run pack                # .deb, .AppImage and .tar.gz land in windows/release/
```

## Setup

Click the Coucou icon in the menu bar (macOS) or in the system tray (Windows, Linux) → **Settings…**

| What | Why | Where the key goes |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code hooks** | live sessions and approvals | **Install hooks** — Coucou backs up `~/.claude/settings.json`, merges its hooks and shows you the diff before writing anything |
| **Anthropic API key** | chat and questions about files | Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service |
| Stripe, n8n, GitHub, Vercel, Resend, Notion, Cal.com | the integration pills | Keychain / Windows Credential Manager / Linux Secret Service, all optional |

If Coucou isn't running, the hook exits immediately: **Claude Code is never blocked.**

## Things to try

| Do this | Mochi does that |
|---|---|
| Hover the notch (top edge on Windows and Linux) | peeks out and says hi 👋 |
| Click it | opens |
| Hover Mochi | blinks, eyes grow |
| Click Mochi | squish + annoyed |
| Click 3 times fast | 😵‍💫 dizzy for a few seconds |
| Drag a file onto the island | turns into a box and swallows it |
| Drag Mochi onto a window *(macOS)* | attaches it as context |

## How it works

**macOS**

- **Island**: a borderless `NSPanel` hugging the notch, driven by a small state machine (`hidden → petit → home`).
- **Character**: drawn in SwiftUI `Canvas` + `TimelineView` at 60 fps — squircle body, eyes projected on a sphere, spring animations. No Rive, no Lottie, no images.
- **Claude Code**: a tiny `nb-hook` script receives hook events and forwards them over a Unix socket to the app. For approvals it waits for your click, then answers the hook.
- **Integrations**: lightweight pollers, paused when nothing is watching.
- **Sounds**: 28 short WAVs played through preloaded `AVAudioPlayer`s.

The macOS app is native Swift 6 / SwiftUI / AppKit with **zero third-party dependencies**.

**Windows**

- A [Tauri 2](https://tauri.app) app (Rust + TypeScript): the island is a transparent, always-on-top window that never steals focus, Mochi is drawn in Canvas 2D with the same shapes, timings and sounds as on the Mac.
- Claude Code hooks go through a tiny `coucou-hook.exe` and a named pipe; keys live in Windows Credential Manager.
- Details and differences in [`windows/README.md`](windows/README.md).

**Linux**

- The same Tauri app as Windows, built from the same `windows/` folder, on WebKitGTK under X11/XWayland.
- Claude Code hooks go through `coucou-hook` and a private Unix socket; keys live in the Secret Service (GNOME Keyring, KWallet…).
- Packaged as `.deb`, AppImage and `.tar.gz` — see the [Linux section](windows/README.md#linux).
