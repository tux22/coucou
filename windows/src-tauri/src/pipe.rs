// Relay server for coucou-hook.
//
// One connection per hook event, over whatever `platform::serve_relay`
// provides: a named pipe on Windows, a Unix socket on Linux. Every hook event is
// forwarded to the island as a `hook` event. `PermissionRequest` is the only one
// that keeps its connection open: it waits for the island's decision and writes
// it back on the same pipe, which is how approving from the island works.
//
// Claude Code is never blocked by us. Three things guarantee it:
//   * coucou-hook gives the connection 300 ms and exits cleanly if we are closed;
//   * we only wait for a human once the island has *confirmed* the card is on
//     screen, so a paused island or a webview that is not listening costs a few
//     hundred milliseconds, not two minutes;
//   * whatever happens we drop the connection after the decision timeout, and
//     the terminal takes over.
//
// What we write back is the bare word `allow` or `deny`. Turning that into the
// documented hookSpecificOutput JSON is coucou-hook's job, so the wire format
// Claude Code expects lives in exactly one place.
